1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,960
Now before you start,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,770
here are 10 quick considerations on how to take this course.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,800
And I promise they are super short and super important.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,493
So, please don't skip this video.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,770
And first of all,

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,500
there are many different types of students in this course.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,670
Some have never programmed in their life,

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,580
others have experienced with other languages,

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,380
but not with JavaScript.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,290
And even others have some experience with JavaScript,

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,050
but want to become even more advanced.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,050
And this course is for all of you, everyone is welcome.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,670
So, please don't write a bad review right away

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,800
if the course is too easy

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,240
or too hard

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,090
or progressing too slow or too fast for you.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,640
I built this course with everyone in mind.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,380
Now, to make the course perfect for you,

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,780
you can always rewatch lectures,

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,650
jump to other more advanced sections,

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,540
watch the course with slower or faster playback speed,

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,990
or ask questions in the Q&amp;A section.

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,460
Of course you can give a one-star review

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,430
if the course is absolutely terrible,

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,690
but please, at least wait a couple of sections

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,883
to get a good idea of the course.

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,210
Now, about actually taking the course,

28
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,700
you need to code along with me.

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,040
And this is crucial,

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,530
you will learn exactly zero JavaScript skills

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,660
by just sitting and watching me code.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,180
So, you have to code yourself,

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,860
even if you're just typing the same code

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,170
as I am typing in the video.

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,023
It doesn't matter as long as you're coding.

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,010
Next, try all the coding challenges.

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,920
Do the best that you can,

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,260
but if you get stuck for too long,

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,730
then simply watch the solution.

40
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,120
And I can't stress this enough,

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,870
you have to try the coding challenges,

42
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,787
because otherwise, you will miss

43
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:10,450
half of the learning opportunity in this course.

44
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,750
And please don't beat yourself up

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,900
if you can figure out the solution.

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,870
This is completely normal, trust me.

47
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,650
And figuring out the solution,

48
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,710
is actually not even the main point of these challenges.

49
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,410
So, if that happens,

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,200
just rewatch the lectures that were covered,

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,083
try to understand them better and move on.

52
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,150
If you want the course material to stick, then take notes.

53
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,220
Notes on code syntax,

54
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,420
notes on theory concepts,

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,310
and really notes on everything.

56
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,720
You can't take too many notes,

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,871
and everyone has their own style,

58
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,863
so, just find yours.

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,810
Now, if this is your first time ever programming,

60
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,800
then please don't get overwhelmed.

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,710
It's 100% normal that will not understand everything

62
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,160
at the beginning.

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,370
Just keep going through the first few sections,

64
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,690
even if you don't understand everything at first,

65
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,410
you soon will, believe me.

66
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,820
But please just don't think,

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,150
I guess coding is not for me.

68
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,100
That thought is simply not allowed here, okay?

69
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,330
So, keep in mind that everyone

70
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,480
has different learning speeds.

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,350
I have seen tens of thousands of students,

72
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,550
progressing through my courses,

73
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,060
so, believe me,

74
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,013
this is completely normal.

75
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,620
In the first couple of sections of the course,

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,360
don't bother understanding exactly why things work

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,100
the way they do in JavaScript.

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,720
Also in the beginning,

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,350
don't stress about efficient code,

80
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,700
or fast code, or clean code.

81
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,600
That's all super important,

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,100
don't get me wrong.

83
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,770
But in the first few sections while still learning,

84
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,220
we just want to make things to work.

85
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,340
We will understand the why, later in the course,

86
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,423
and of course make the code clean as well.

87
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,370
The sections in the course built on one another.

88
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,200
So, before moving on from a section,

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,670
make sure that you understand exactly what was covered.

90
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,050
So, take a break,

91
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,350
review the code that we wrote,

92
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,830
review your notes

93
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,460
and review the projects that we built.

94
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,200
And maybe even write some code yourself

95
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,040
in order to practice.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,313
Only then, you're ready to move on.

97
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,470
If you ever have an error in your code,

98
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,920
or a question,

99
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,310
always start by trying to solve it yourself,

100
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,060
because this is absolutely essential for your progress.

101
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,670
Now, if you cannot solve the problem,

102
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,150
then check the Q&amp;A section,

103
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,640
because someone probably already had

104
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,740
the same problem before.

105
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,060
And if that doesn't help either,

106
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,930
then just ask a new question.

107
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,160
And to do that,

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,170
use a short description,

109
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,500
post your code on codepen.io,

110
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,410
and shared the link in the Q&amp;A.

111
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,280
Because without the code,

112
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,173
we will not be able to help you.

113
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,380
I built and recorded this course on a Mac,

114
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,380
but everything works the exact same way on Windows or Linux.

115
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,950
So, if something doesn't work on your computer,

116
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,500
it's not because you're using

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,493
a different operating system, okay?

118
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,980
And now, finally,

119
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,520
and most importantly, have fun.

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,790
Coding is a lot of fun.

121
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,530
And it's so rewarding to see something

122
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,066
that you have built yourself.

123
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,630
So, if you're feeling frustrated for some reason,

124
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,390
stop whatever you're doing and come back later.

125
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,090
Always, always have fun while coding, okay?

126
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,593
And with that being said, let's now get started.
