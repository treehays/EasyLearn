1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,110
Now before we can write any code,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,360
we need to install and configure a code editor.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,275
So a code editor is the main tool for any developer

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:17,275
and we use it as the name says to write our actual code.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,930
And so let's now go download a code editor.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,480
And the one that I advise everyone to use

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,150
is Visual Studio Code or VS Code for short.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,890
So this is in my opinion,

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,840
the best code editor by far that exists.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,520
And that's not just my own opinion.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,254
So VS Code is right now by far the most popular

12
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:47,020
and most widely used code editor and that is for a reason.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,990
It simply is the best and easiest to use and of course,

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,950
it is completely free.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,760
Now there are alternatives if you don't like VS Code

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,152
for some reason.

17
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:02,660
So you can use Adam or you can use something like Brackets

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,080
as well, which is the code editor that I used

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,593
to teach a previous version of this course.

20
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:13,500
But again, I'm going to use VS Code in this course.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,455
And so, I really advise you to follow this course,

22
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:20,430
using the exact same code editor to make everything easier

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,894
for you to follow.

24
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:25,975
So again, this code editor is completely free

25
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:29,240
and it works on every platform.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,760
So just download whatever installer that you need

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,410
for your own platform, then install of course,

28
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,790
that code editor on your computer.

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,960
And once you're done, come back to this video,

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,030
so that we can together set it up a little bit,

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,463
just so that we can get started in the next section.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,960
Okay, so I hope that you managed to install VS Code

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,614
on your system and as you open it up,

34
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:59,395
it should look something like this.

35
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:03,230
Now, the colors should probably all be different,

36
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,270
but we will fix that in a second.

37
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,934
And maybe this welcome screen also looks different.

38
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,532
And maybe this icons here

39
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:13,420
because you might've installed the editor sometime

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,254
after I recorded this video.

41
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:19,433
But anyway, the main things should still work the same.

42
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:24,433
And so let's actually start by installing a theme.

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,090
So a theme is basically all the colors that you see

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,260
are on the screen.

45
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,490
And also the color is in the actual code

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,730
that you're going to write.

47
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,597
Okay, now you don't need to install a theme.

48
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:40,420
So you can simply change one of the themes

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,913
that is already included in VS Code.

50
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,617
So just click down here on this icon and then color theme.

51
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:51,395
And then here, you can try one of these out.

52
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:53,840
And so if you like one of them,

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,960
you can simply keep that one.

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,555
But as you see, the theme that I have is this monokai pro

55
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:04,555
and this one was not included by default by VS Code.

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,830
And so if you want to install the same theme as I have,

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,318
then simply come here to this extensions tab

58
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,203
and then search for monokai pro.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,040
Okay, then it's this first one here.

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,540
And then you can simply, probably somewhere here,

61
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,012
click on download.

62
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:29,975
Now this theme is actually a paid theme that you can buy

63
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:33,600
for about 10 U.S. dollars or so.

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,270
However, you can actually also use the theme

65
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,130
for free forever.

66
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,369
It will then just ask you every couple of days

67
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:42,460
for you to buy it.

68
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,049
But for me, that has never been a big problem.

69
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,260
Now, I just wanted to quickly mention that I'm not

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,400
in any way affiliated with the theme

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,410
and that this is not an advertisement.

72
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,391
So this is simply the theme that I love

73
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:00,000
and that I use every single day.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,940
But of course, you can use a different theme

75
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,050
or a theme that you have already been using yourself.

76
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,560
But if you like to theme,

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,120
then you can support the creator or you can use the theme

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,860
for free or you can, of course also use another theme.

79
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,991
And one other theme that is very similar

80
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:23,168
and which actually already comes with VS Code

81
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:27,093
is monokai classic.

82
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,230
So it's this one.

83
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,100
So the colors here look a little bit different,

84
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,734
but the monokai pro theme that I use is actually based

85
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,230
on this one.

86
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,280
And so therefore, colors are quite similar.

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,071
And so therefore, this one is also a good pick

88
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:46,810
in case you want to use a very similar theme to mine,

89
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,850
but don't want to use monokai pro,

90
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,460
but I'm gonna set it back to monokai pro now.

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,280
And so that's it about the theme.

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,880
And so, let's not move on and also talk

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,229
about VS Code settings.

94
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,410
And so here, I'm going to show you a couple of settings

95
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,053
that I'm using in the course videos

96
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,643
and that you should probably use as well

97
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,809
to make it easier for you to follow the videos

98
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:15,610
and also to code on your own later on.

99
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,871
So the first setting is this auto save setting

100
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:22,273
that you should set to on focus change.

101
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:25,871
Okay and so, what this will do is that whenever

102
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:30,320
you leave the code editor or you go to some other file,

103
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,050
then it will automatically save that file without you having

104
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,770
to do anything.

105
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,813
And so, that's very helpful.

106
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:40,565
Now, if this isn't showing up here for you,

107
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:44,488
up here, you can simply search for everything.

108
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:48,947
So you can simply search auto save like this.

109
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:52,550
And then again, change it to unfocused change.

110
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,780
Then you could also change the font size,

111
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,911
but that's not really important for you.

112
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:01,807
Then another one is this multi cursor modifier.

113
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:04,074
And this one sounds a bit weird,

114
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:08,091
but you can simply set it to control command.

115
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:10,370
Or you can leave it at alt.

116
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,910
So just when you need it,

117
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,714
just know which of the two you selected.

118
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:18,180
But for now, again, this is not important.

119
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,793
I will only start using it a bit later.

120
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:24,529
Then I also have the word wrap turned on,

121
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,892
but again, that's not that important.

122
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:32,892
Okay, so I think those are actually the most important ones.

123
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,890
There's just another one that you need to change.

124
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,890
And that is called format on save.

125
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,731
All right, so just turn this one here on,

126
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:50,070
which says that a formatter must be available and by now,

127
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,314
it is not, but in one of the next sections,

128
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:54,955
we will actually install a formatter

129
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,830
to automatically format our code.

130
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,010
And by then, this setting here must be turned on.

131
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,010
Okay and that's actually it for this lecture already.

132
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,510
Now, just notice that I'm working on a Mac here,

133
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,428
but everything will work exactly the same on Windows

134
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:14,326
and on Linux.

135
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:18,050
So this VS Code editor as I mentioned earlier,

136
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,014
works just the same on all the platforms.

137
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:26,014
Now, just one final and small adjustment that we can make,

138
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,889
which I just remembered

139
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,031
is that besides changing the main color theme,

140
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,834
we can also change the theme of the file icons.

141
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,411
And so again, if you want your VS Code

142
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:40,727
to look exactly the same as mine,

143
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:45,727
then you can select these Seti icons here.

144
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,230
So by default, I think it should be this minimal,

145
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,070
but I prefer these ones here.

146
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,120
And so, by selecting this one here,

147
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,489
then your code editor

148
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:59,580
will probably look exactly the same as mine.

149
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,370
All right and with that, we are actually ready to move on.

150
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,490
Just make sure that you also have the latest version

151
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,951
of Google Chrome installed on your computer

152
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,450
because that is going to be the browser

153
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,050
in which we will be testing our code.

154
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,970
All right, but with that,

155
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,420
we are now really done with this video.

156
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,803
And so, I'll see you in the next one.
