00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
(soothing music)

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,890
Welcome to the first section of the course.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,650
In this section, you will start learning the very basics

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,720
of the JavaScript language.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,350
So things like variables, data types, operators,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,600
if-else statements and more.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,140
So in this part we will not yet start building

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,650
beautiful user interfaces.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,400
We will do that later, of course, but first we need to focus

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,640
on the language fundamentals

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,160
and so these lectures are designed

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,530
for you to learn these fundamentals

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,640
and to give you an overview of the language

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,253
before we actually dive deeper in later sections.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,797
Okay, so let's go start this journey right now.

00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:51,380
